# Parsing

## What is schema.Parse()?

To validate and parse your data into a destination pointer you can use the `schema.Parse()` function. The function signature looks like this:

```go
schema.Parse(data, &dest, options...)
```

This works with any Zog Schema:

```go
// string
var dest string
z.String().Min(3).Parse("test", &dest)
// structs
var dest User
z.Struct(z.Schema{"name": z.String().Min(3)}).Parse(map[string]any{"name": "test"}, &dest)
```

Under the hood Zog follows the [Parsing Execution Structure](#parsing-execution-structure) and does a bunch of things under the hood to make sure your data is parsed correctly. Such as checking for zero values, coercing types, etc...

## Parsing Struct Tags

By default zog will use the schema field name as the key for the parsed value. For example:

```go
type User struct {
	Name string `zog:"name"`
}
z.Struct(z.Schema{"name": z.String()}).Parse(map[string]any{"name": "test"}, &User{}) // note zog will fetch the value as map[name]
type User struct {
   Name string `zog:"name"`
}
z.Struct(z.Schema{"Name": z.String()}).Parse(map[string]any{"name": "test"}, &User{}) // note zog will fetch the value as map[Name]
```

However, this is not always practical. For example, you may have data coming in in kebab case and you want to parse it into camel case. For this Zog supports a few struct tags:

- `zog` tag which works for any input data
- `json` tag which works for JSON input data
- `form` tag which works for form input data
- `query` tag which works for query string input data
- `env` tag which works for environment variables see [zenv](/packages/zenv) for more info

> The priority of keys is as follows:
> `zog` -> `json` || `form` || `query` || `env` -> schema field name
> So be careful when using `zog` tag as it will override the other tags.

```go
type User struct {
   Name string `zog:"first-name"` // this
   LastName string `query:"last_name" json:"last-name"`
}
z.Struct(z.Schema{"name": z.String(), "lastName": z.String()}).Parse(map[string]any{"first-name": "test", "lastName": "Doe"}, &User{})
```

## Coercion

Zog will attempt to coerce the data into the correct type. For example if you have a `z.Int()` schema and you pass in a `"1"` it will be coerced into an `int` type. This behaviour, like almost everything else in Zog, can be customized. Zog provides two main ways to customize coercion:

- [Global Coercion](/configuration#coercion) - Change the default coercion behaviour for all schemas. More details on this in the [configuration page](/configuration#coercion).
- [Per schema coercers](#per-schema-coercers) - Define custom coercion functions for your schemas.

#### Per schema coercers

You can define custom coercion functions for your schemas by using the `z.WithCoercer()` schema option.

```go
z.String(z.WithCoercer(func(data any) (any, error) {
   return "test", nil // now the result will be "test" no matter the input
})).Parse("abc", &dest) // dest will be "test"
```

## Parsing Execution Structure

1. Pretransforms
   - On error all parsing and validation stops and [ZogIssues](/errors) are returned.
   - Can be caught by catch
2. Default Check -> Assigns default value if the value is nil value
3. Optional Check -> Stops validation if the value is nil value
4. Casting -> Attempts to cast the value to the correct type
   - On error all parsing and validation stops and [ZogIssues](/errors) are returned
   - Can be caught by catch
5. Required check ->
   - On error: aborts if the value is its nil value and returns a required [ZogIssue](/errors).
   - Can be caught by catch
6. Tests -> Run all tests on the value (including required)
   - On error: validation [ZogIssues](/errors) are added to the [ZogIssueList](/errors#zogissuelist) or [ZogIssueMap](/errors#zogissuelist). All validation functions are run even if one of them fails.
   - Can be caught by catch
7. PostTransforms -> Run all postTransforms on the value.
   - On error you return: aborts and adds your error to the list of [ZogIssues](/errors)
   - Only run on valid values. Won't run if a [ZogIssue](/errors) was created before the postTransforms
